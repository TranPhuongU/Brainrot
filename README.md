# Brainrot – Merge & Pour Mayhem!

**Brainrot Blender** is a casual mobile mini-game where you swipe to drop quirky “brainrot” characters into a cup.  
Match identical characters to trigger explosive fusions and evolve bigger, weirder versions!  
But beware — if the cup overflows for more than **3 seconds**, it’s **Game Over**!
